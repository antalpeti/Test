 * <h2>Class Diagram Example (private fields, public methods)</h2>
 * <p>
 * The Car class has private instance variables carColor, carPrice denoted by (-) in the UML Class
 * diagram. Similarly if this was public then it would have been represented as (+), if was
 * protected then it is denoted by (#). The package visibility is defined by (~).<br>
 * The return type of the instance variables or the methods are represented next to the colon (:)
 * sign. Structure: [visibility] [multiplicity] [:type [=default value]] {property string} Example:
 * carPrice : double = 0.0

 * <h2>Class Diagram Example 2 (static fields, static methods)</h2>
 * <p>
 * The static data is represented with an underline.

 *
 * <h2>Association Example</h2>
 * <p>
 * The association represents the static relationship between two classes along with the
 * multiplicity. Association are represented as thin line connecting two classes. Association can be
 * unidirectional (shown by arrow at one end) or bidirectional (shown by arrow at both end).

 * <h2>Multiplicity Example</h2>
 * <p>
 * The below diagram explains a unidirectional association with a one to may relationship. Both use
 * of ArrayList and Array is for illustration purposes only.
 * </p>

 *
 * <h2>Generalization Example</h2>
 * <p>
 * This property represents the inheritance feature of the object oriented concept. In Java this can
 * relate to the “extends” keyword. The inheritance should ideally follow the Liskov Substitution
 * Principle i.e. the subtype should be able to substitute for its supertype. It helps to make the
 * code implicitly follow the Open Close Principle i.e. Open for extension but closed for
 * modification.
 * </p>

 *
 * <h2>Realization Example</h2>
 * <p>
 * This is related to the relationship between the class and the interface. The realization is
 * equivalent to the “implements” keyword in Java.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <img src="./realization_example.gif" alt="Realization Example" width="100%">

 *
 * <h2>Dependency</h2>
 * <p>
 * Dependency is a relationship that shows that a class is dependent on another class for its
 * existence or implementation. Dependency relationship is shown as a dotted line with an arrow from
 * source class to the dependent class. In Java we can consider the dependency relationship if the
 * source class has a reference to the dependent class directly or source class has methods through
 * which the dependent objects are passed as a parameter or refers to the static operation’s of the
 * dependent class or source class has a local variable referring to the dependent class etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>

 *
 * <h2>Aggregation</h2>
 * <p>
 * This shows “has a” relationship. It is a form of association relationship. This relationship
 * highlights that a whole is made of its parts. So if a whole is destroyed the part still remains.
 * In UML this is represented through a hollow diamond with the diamond symbol pointing towards the
 * whole. In case of Java the aggregation follows the same structure as association. It is
 * represented through the instance variables of a class.
 * </p>
 * <p>

 *
 * <h2>Composition</h2>
 * <p>
 * This is again a whole or part relationship where if the whole is destroyed then the part cannot
 * exist independently. Another important point about Composition is that the part at any point in
 * time can have only one owner. E.g. A person can be an employee of one company at any point in
 * time due to contractual obligations. That person cannot hold dual work authorisation. If the
 * Company goes bankrupt the employee of this company does not exist and will be fired. The
 * composition is represented as a filled diamond with data flowing in single direction from the
 * whole to the part. The composition in Java is represented in the same form as aggregation with
 * help of instance variables.
